**MVVM Architecture Sample using UIKit and JSONPlaceholder Todo API**

This project demonstrates a simple MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture in an iOS app using UIKit and a binding pattern to fetch and display data from the JSONPlaceholder Todo API.

**Features**

**MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the MVVM design pattern to separate concerns and improve code readability and maintainability.

**Binding Pattern:** Implements a simple binding mechanism between ViewModel and View for state updates.

**API Integration:** Fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API for demonstration purposes.

**Project Structure**

**Model:** Represents the Todo data model, structured based on the API response.

**View:** Uses UIKit to display a list of todos in a UITableView.

**ViewModel:** Holds the business logic, fetching data from the API and binding updates to the view.
